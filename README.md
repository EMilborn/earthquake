# EarthquakeBy Nobel Gautam, Farhan Haque, Gabriel Marks, Elias MilbornVideo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oEDVHYj_vhgEarthquake is a 2-player game. Each player spawns as a ball in a randomly chosen map. Their objective is to kill each other before being killed. The players battle it out in a best-of-9 format, with the first player to 5 rounds winning the game. Each game affects the players' elo, which can be viewed in the player profile page.Movement is controlled by WASD. Shooting is done by clicking with the left mouse button. Shooting releases a projectile, which the enemy player is able to dodge due to the slow speed. Each player is limited in what they see, and must explore the map ready to shoot wherever the opponent is likely to appear.## NotesWhen running locally, it's recommended to have 2 different browsers for each player, or normal session + incognito/private browsing mode, so that the logins don't conflict.
